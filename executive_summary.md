• ROI: 15:1 in first year

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (1-4 Weeks):
1. Implement mandatory phishing awareness training
2. Deploy simulated phishing campaigns monthly
3. Establish clear reporting procedures
4. Review and update email filtering rules

### Medium-Term Actions (1-3 Months):

2. Introduce phishing reporting button in email clients
3. Conduct department-specific risk assessments
4. Develop incident response playbooks

### Long-Term Strategy (3-6 Months):
1. Build security culture with regular updates
2. Implement advanced threat protection
3. Establish metrics and KPIs for continuous improvement
4. Integrate phishing awareness into onboarding

##SUCCESS METRICS TO MONITOR

### Monthly Metrics:
• Phishing email reporting rate (target: >70%)
